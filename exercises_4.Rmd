## Exercises 4


```{python}
from numpy import array
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import one_hot
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten,Embedding,Dense

import tensorflow as tf
import keras

```

Load the data. You should have 2K files, first 1K are tagged negatively, the rest are tagged as positive.

```{python}
from string import punctuation
from os import listdir
from collections import Counter
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
 
# load doc into memory
def load_doc(filename):
	# open the file as read only
	file = open(filename, 'r')
	# read all text
	text = file.read()
	# close the file
	file.close()
	return text
 
# turn a doc into clean tokens
def clean_doc(doc):
	# split into tokens by white space
	tokens = doc.split()
	# remove punctuation from each token
	table = str.maketrans('', '', punctuation)
	tokens = [w.translate(table) for w in tokens]
	# remove remaining tokens that are not alphabetic
	tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalpha()]
	# filter out stop words
	stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
	tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w in stop_words]
	# filter out short tokens
	tokens = [word for word in tokens if len(word) > 1]
	return tokens
 
# load doc and add to vocab
def add_doc_to_vocab(filename, vocab):
	# load doc
	doc = load_doc(filename)
	# clean doc
	tokens = clean_doc(doc)
	# update counts
	vocab.update(tokens)
 
# load all docs in a directory
def process_docs(directory, vocab, is_trian):
	# walk through all files in the folder
	for filename in listdir(directory):
		# skip any reviews in the test set
		if is_trian and filename.startswith('cv9'):
			continue
		if not is_trian and not filename.startswith('cv9'):
			continue
		# create the full path of the file to open
		path = directory + '/' + filename
		# add doc to vocab
		add_doc_to_vocab(path, vocab)
 
# define vocab
vocab = Counter()
# add all docs to vocab
process_docs('txt_sentoken/neg', vocab, True)
process_docs('txt_sentoken/pos', vocab, True)

```

Explore the data. E.g. what are the most frequent words, what is a typical length for a review (in number of words)? Choose a random text and display it, before and after parsing.

```{python}
# print the size of the vocab
print(len(vocab))
# print the top words in the vocab
print(vocab.most_common(50))

```



```{python}
# save tokens to a vocabulary file
# save list to file
def save_list(lines, filename):
	# convert lines to a single blob of text
	data = '\n'.join(lines)
	# open file
	file = open(filename, 'w')
	# write text
	file.write(data)
	# close file
	file.close()
	
tokens = [i for i,j in vocab.items() if j > 2]
save_list(tokens, 'vocab.txt')
```


Use the Keras tokenizer function to create a dictionary of the top, say, 30K most frequently used words. Use the texts_to_sequences function to transform the text into a series of integers.

```{python}
keras.texts_to_sequences(vocab)

```

Letâ€™s use the first 600 words of each review as features. Pad each shorter review with zeros, use pad_sequences function for this.

Split the sample into 2/3 training and 1/3 testing1.

Create neural net which takes embeddings as an input, and predict the sentiment of the text. Vary the dimension of the embeddings.

Report the accuracy. What is your benchmark?
